`{r setup, include=FALSE} knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)`

## Project

In this project, data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of
the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone was retrieved, worked with, and cleaned,
to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Data source

A full description of the data used is this project is available at the

## Data description

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers
within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six
activities (WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING,
STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the
waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant
rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data
manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two
sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the
training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by
applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows
of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor
acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components,
was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration
and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low
frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency
was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by
calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

## Files

  - **README.md** a text file that provides an overview of the data and
    scripts
  - **CodeBook.md** a code book that describes the variables, the data
    and any transformations made to clean and tidy up the data
  - **run\_analysis.R** collects and reads the data and then followed by
    the 5 following steps:
      - Merges the training and test sets to create one signe data set
      - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard
        deviation for each measurement
      - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the
        data set
      - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable
        names
      - Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of
        each variable for each activity and each subject
  - **tidy\_dataset.txt** a text file containing the exported final data
    after going through all the steps described above

## Requirements

The script requires the dplyr package (version 1.0.3 was used)
